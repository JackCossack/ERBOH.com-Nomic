1. Players take 24 hour turns adding a proposal to the game. A proposal can be changing an existing rule, deleting an existing rule, or making a completely new rule. You may only make 1 proposal on your turn. The player(s) whose turn it is can be found in the Turn_Order.md file in the GitHub repository linked below.  
2. When a proposal is made, a Game Moderator will add it to Voting.md file. If the rule has more votes for than against after 48 hours of it being in Voting.md file, it will be added to Official_Rules.md file (or other appropriate thing will happen) and it will have an immediate effect from then on.  
3. The first player to reach 1000 points, wins the game.
