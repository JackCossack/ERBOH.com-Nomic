1. Players take 24 hour turns adding a proposal to the game. A proposal can be changing an existing rule, deleting an existing rule, or making a completely new rule. You may only make 1 proposal on your turn. The player(s) whose turn it is can be found in the Turn_Order.md file.  
2. When a proposal is made, a Game Moderator will add it to Voting.md file. If the rule has more votes for than against after 48 hours of it being in Voting.md file, it will be added to Official_Rules.md file (or other appropriate thing will happen) and it will have an immediate effect from then on.  
3. The first player to reach 1000 points, wins the game.
4. Every player gets 5 points each day.
5. Lynching Sam is worth 400 points.
6. If a players proposal is denied in a vote of 3-2, then they receive 10 points.
7. This rule introduces a concept of the game map. The map is a hexagonal grid with coordinates, currently depicted here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnVLqLqNQ7iVAQXp_1oJd-I862wmSnIG4uE16uOJ5AM/edit?usp=sharing . This map is an extension to this rule, and any game-mechanic relevant changes to it (as opposed to purely-aesthetic, or game-state-tracking changes) counts as a change to this rule.  
 The initial position of every new player and of every player already in the game at the time of this rule passing is (0, 0). Every turn, each player can make up to two moves to an adjacent grid cell.
