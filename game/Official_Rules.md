1. Players take 24 hour turns adding a proposal to the game. A proposal can be changing an existing rule, deleting an existing rule, or making a completely new rule. You may only make 1 proposal on your turn. The player(s) whose turn it is can be found in the Turn_Order.md file.  
2. When a proposal is made, a Game Moderator will add it to Voting.md file. If the rule has more votes for than against after 48 hours of it being in Voting.md file, it will be added to Official_Rules.md file (or other appropriate thing will happen) and it will have an immediate effect from then on.  
3. The first player to reach 1000 points, wins the game.
4. Every player gets 5 points each day.
5. Lynching Sam is worth 400 points.
6. If a players proposal is denied in a vote of 3-2, then they receive 10 points.
7. This rule introduces a concept of the game map. The map is a hexagonal grid with coordinates, currently depicted here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnVLqLqNQ7iVAQXp_1oJd-I862wmSnIG4uE16uOJ5AM/edit?usp=sharing . This map is an extension to this rule, and any game-mechanic relevant changes to it (as opposed to purely-aesthetic, or game-state-tracking changes) counts as a change to this rule.  
 The initial position of every new player and of every player already in the game at the time of this rule passing is (0, 0). Every turn, each player can make up to two moves to an adjacent grid cell.
8. If two players move to the same space on the game map, they have the option to initiate a duel that awards 52 points to the winner. The duel must be agreed upon by both parties. The terms of the duel are arbitrary as long as both parties agree to them.
9. A player cannot use a space if they have left it before.
10. Any person that is not a player yet can become one by making a post expressing their will to become one in the game's forum thread. They will then be placed in a random positon in the turn order, and receive a number of points equal to half the median of current players' points, rounded down.
11. The player limit shall be set to 10 players maximum.
12. Every day, 3 points are given to whoever is in the last place at that time. That is in addition to any other gains.
13. A player can choose, within the time limit of their turn to propose, to willingly skip their proposal, and receive 10 points. The player cannot simply miss their turn and get a pay-out, they have to willingly state on the thread their intention to skip their proposal phase and receive their pay-out, which needs to be done by the time limit of their proposal phase.
14. Every proposal that passes after the enactment of this rule will grant the player who made the proposal 16 points.
