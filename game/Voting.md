Log's proposal:  
**This rule introduces an NPC, named Dave, that aimlessly wanders around the grid every turn. This aimless wandering involves a game moderator rolling a D6 twice, with 1 being up-left, 2 being up-right, 3 being right, 4 being down-right, 5 being down-left, 6 being left. Each dice roll makes it move a space in the corresponding direction. If it’s incapable of moving in that direction, then it just doesn’t move. Each player receives 20 points the first time they and Dave are on the same space. Dave's starting position is (0,0). For the purpose of rules resticting movement, Dave is treated as a player.**
