Kubby' proposal:  
**Each player can either be active or inactive. Turns of inactive players are skipped. An active player becomes an inactive player if they fail to make the action(s) they have to make on their turn twice in a row. An inactive player can become an active player if they make any action or otherwise express their interest in returning to the game. With the enactment of this rule, Poles and YN shall be set as inactive players, and every other player as active players.**
