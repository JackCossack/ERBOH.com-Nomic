Kubby's proposal:
**This rule introduces a "Section Influence" statistic for each player-section pair. For each player-section pair where the section in the pair is claimed by the player in the pair, its Section Influence is set to 3. That applies to both sections already claimed at the time of this rule's enactment, and for previously unclaimed sections claimed while this rule is in force. For any other player-section pair, its Section Influence is set to 0.  
If, at a beginning of a turn, a player is in a section claimed by them, they can reduce the Section Influence of a pair between that section and any other player by up to 2 in total. That reduction can be divided between multiple players. No Section Influence can be reduced below 0.  
If, at a beginning of a turn, a player is in a section claimed by someone else, the Section Influence of a pair between that section and that player is increased by 1.  
When the Section Influence of a player-section pair reaches 3, and that section is not claimed by that player, the section becomes claimed by that player, and Section Influence of any pair between that section and any other player is set to 0. If two or more players meet this condition for a section, the player the section will become claimed by is randomly chosen from players that meet this condition for the section in question.**
