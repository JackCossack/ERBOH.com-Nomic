Kubby's proposal:  
**Every time a player gains a resource from mining, they obtain 1 unit of said resource, additionally to any other benefits. The player can use said resources to craft various items granting them various benefits. The player can craft an item at any time, provided they have resources specified in the item's recipe. The list of craftable items can be found in CraftingRecipes.md file on the game's repository.** (while it's in voting, it's called CraftingRecipesProposal.md)
