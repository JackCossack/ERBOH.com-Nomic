Spars' proposal:  
Append the following to Rule 25:  
**When Dave and a player meet on one space, the player either receives or loses 15 points, each of those outcomes being equally likely. This happens every time unless it is their first meeting, or the meeting takes place in the same space as the previous one.**

Juiz' proposal:  
**If a player shares a space with another player, they can attempt to attack that player's companion. When that happens, a D20 roll is made for both the attacker and the defender. If the attacker's roll is higher than the defenders, the attack succeeds and 2d12 damage is dealt to the defender's companion. If the defender's roll is higher than the attacker's, the attacker is stunned (unable to move or use active abilities not relating to proposal-making process) for one turn. A player cannot challenge another player to a duel and attack their companion in the same turn.**

Kubby's proposal:  
**Every time a player gains a resource from mining, they obtain 1 unit of said resource, additionally to any other benefits. The player can use said resources to craft various items granting them various benefits. The player can craft an item at any time, provided they have resources specified in the item's recipe. The list of craftable items can be found in CraftingRecipes.md file on the game's repository.** (while it's in voting, it's called CraftingRecipesProposal.md)
