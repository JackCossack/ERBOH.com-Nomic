Spars' proposal:  
**Once per turn order, defined as the amount of time required for every player to have a turn, a player can challenge another player to an arbitrary competition agreed upon by both of them. Each player in the competition can gamble up to 50 points. At the competition's conclusion, the winner gains keeps the points they've gambled and gains points gambled by the loser. The loser's gambled points are subtracted from their point count. A player can not challenge the same person to a competition twice in a row.**
