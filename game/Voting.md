Kubby's proposal:  
**This rule introduces a Health system for companions. Each companion's starting and maximum health is 120 health points. If the companion's health points reach 0, the companion becomes unable to use its abilities until either the turn order round ends (after which it regains 30 health points), or until its healed through other means. A companion's health points can be regained by spending the companion's points (in a 1:1 ratio)**

Log's proposal:  
**This rule introduces an NPC, named Dave, that aimlessly wanders around the grid every turn. This aimless wandering involves a game moderator rolling a D6 twice, with 1 being up-left, 2 being up-right, 3 being right, 4 being down-right, 5 being down-left, 6 being left. Each dice roll makes it move a space in the corresponding direction. If it’s incapable of moving in that direction, then it just doesn’t move. Each player receives 20 points the first time they and Dave are on the same space. Dave's starting position is (0,0). For the purpose of rules resticting movement, Dave is treated as a player.**
