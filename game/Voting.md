Kubby's proposal:  
**This rule introduces a Health system for companions. Each companion's starting and maximum health is 120 health points. If the companion's health points reach 0, the companion becomes unable to use its abilities until either the turn order round ends (after which it regains 30 health points), or until its healed through other means. A companion's health points can be regained by spending the companion's points (in a 1:1 ratio)**
